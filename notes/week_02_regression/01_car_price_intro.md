### Problem Description

User is selling a car.
We need to develop a Model that will predict for user a car price.

### Dataset information

Link for Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset

### Project Plan:
1. Prepare data and do EDA (Exploratory data analysis)
2. Use linear regression for predicting price
3. Understand the internals of linear regression
4. Evaluating the model with RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
5. Feature engineering
6. Regularization
7. Using the model



The code and dataset are available at this [link](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/chapter-02-car-price).
