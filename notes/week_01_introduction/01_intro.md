### Car Classifieds example

**In a dealership**, knowing information about a car (year, make, model, mileage, etc.), an *expert* can determine the car's price based on the knowledge of similar car prices. They extract PATTERNS from DATA for price prediction.

### ML model and Model Training

An **ML model** extracts PATTERNS from DATA and encapsulates all of them in the **Model**.

**Features** - information that we know about cars (year, model, mileage, etc.).

**Target** - what we want our model to predict (price).

### Predictions

Using this model, we can make predictions for prices of cars for which we don't know the price.

**Predictions** - information that the **Model** outputs (predicts) using **Features** (all the DATA about objects without **Target**)
